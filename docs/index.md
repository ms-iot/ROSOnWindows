# ROS for Windows
People have always been fascinated by robots. Today advanced robots are changing our lives, both at work and at home. Warehouse robots have enabled next-day deliveries to online shoppers, and many pet owners rely on robotic vacuums to keep their floors clean. 
Industries as diverse as manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, and real estate are seeing benefits from robots. As robots have advanced, so have the development tools. Many developers leverage the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://ros.org), 
a set of libraries and tools which help you build complex robots. ROS is used in many cutting-edge robotic projects around the world. 

Microsoft is excited to announce the release of ROS 1 for Windows. This will bring the manageability and security of Windows 10 IoT Enterprise to the innovative ROS ecosystem.

Windows has been a trusted part of robotic and industrial systems for decades. With ROS for Windows, developers will be able to use the familiar Visual Studio toolset along with rich AI and cloud features. 

We’re looking forward to bringing the intelligent edge to robotics by exposing advanced features like hardware accelerated Windows Machine Learning, computer vision, Azure Cognitive Services, Azure IoT cloud services, and other Microsoft technologies to home, education, commercial, and industrial robots. 
Manufacturers want to make robots more aware of their surroundings, easier to program and safer to be around. Governments, manufacturers, and academics around the world are investing in the next generation of manufacturing, sometimes referred to as “Industry 4.0”.
