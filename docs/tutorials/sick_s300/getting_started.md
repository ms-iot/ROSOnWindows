SICK S300 Safety Laser Scanner
==============================

In this post, I will show you how to get started with **SICK S300 Safety Laser Scanner** in a ROS workspace.
I will begin with an empty workspace, add required ROS packages, define and run an exmaple ROS application, and check laser scan in the ROS visualization tools.

In this tutorial, I will be using **cob_sick_s300**, a community ROS package, to drive **SICK S300** to get the laser scan messages into ROS topics.

For more information, see [http://wiki.ros.org/cob_sick_s300](http://wiki.ros.org/cob_sick_s300).

## Prerequisite

  * You have a machine with `Windows 10` installed.
  * You have [`ROS Melodic Desktop Full`](https://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows) installed.
  * You have a **SICK S300 Safety Laser Scanner** commissioned to operate and connected to your host machine over a serial port.
  * This tutorial applies to:
    - [`S300 Standard`](http://www.sick.com/s300_standard)
    - [`S300 Advanced`](http://www.sick.com/s300_advanced)
    - [`S300 Professional`](http://www.sick.com/s300_professional)
    - [`S300 Expert`](http://www.sick.com/s300_expert)

## Step 1: Clone the Driver Package

Firstly, you will need a `catkin` workspace to contain the driver package.
Let's assume you are working on a empty workspace under `c:\s300_ws` and now you need to clone the driver package and its dependencies into the source folder:

```no-highlight
:: change the directory to the source subfolder.
c:\s300_ws> cd src

:: checkout the driver package code.
c:\s300_ws\src> git clone https://github.com/seanyen/cob_sick_s300
c:\s300_ws\src> git clone https://github.com/wjwwood/serial
```

## Step 2: Create your owned Package

Now you have the required packages in your workspace.
By ROS convention, it is common to manage the peripheral nodes in ROS launch files.
However, since we begin this tutorial with an empty workspace, let's create a new package so we can add the ROS launch files later.

```no-highlight
:: change the directory to the source subfolder.
c:\s300_ws> cd src

:: create your owned package
c:\s300_ws\src> catkin_create_pkg my_pkg
```

## Step 3: Build the Workspace

Let's build the workspace to produce the executables and binaries.
And remember to run `setup.bat` to add the development space into the current environment.

```no-highlight
:: Build the workspace
c:\s300_ws> catkin_make

:: Add the development space into the current environment.
c:\s300_ws> devel\setup.bat
```

## Step 4: Write a ROS Launch file running Laser Scanner node

At this moment, you are ready to add new ROS launch file for the new package.
Let's add a new one called `my_pkg.launch`:

```no-highlight
:: Change the directory to new package
c:\s300_ws> roscd my_pkg

:: Create the ROS launch file
C:\workspace\s300_ws\src\my_pkg> mkdir launch && notepad launch\my_pkg.launch
```

Once the `notepad` gets launched, copy and paste the following text into the new file, save it, and close the notepad:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<launch>
    <!-- start laser driver -->
    <node name="laser_front" pkg="cob_sick_s300" type="cob_sick_s300" respawn="false" output="screen">
        <rosparam subst_value="true">
            port: COM1
            baud: 115200
            scan_duration: 0.025 #no info about that in SICK-docu, but 0.025 is believable and looks good in rviz
            scan_cycle_time: 0.040 #SICK-docu says S300 scans every 40ms
            inverted: true
            scan_id: 7
            frame_id: /base_laser_link
            scan_intervals: [[-1.3526, 1.361357]] #[rad] these intervals are included to the scan
        </rosparam>
    </node>

    <!-- start ROS visualization tools -->
    <node name="rqt_gui" pkg="rqt_gui" type="rqt_gui"/>
    <node name="rviz" pkg="rviz" type="rviz"/>
</launch>
```

Before we move forward, let's take a look some important parameters to accommodate your environment:

  * `port` should be pointed to where the `SICK S300` connnected to your host machine.
  * `baud` should be the baudrate configured by the `SICK S300`.

## Step 5: Start to Run ROS application

After everything is correctly configured, you are ready to run it.

```no-highlight
:: Run the ROS launch file
c:\s300_ws> roslaunch my_pkg my_pkg.launch
```

A few moments later, you will see `rqt` and `rviz` tools running.
On the `rqt`, you can turn on the real-time monitoring on the topic `/laser_front/scan`.

And on the `rviz`, you can add built-in `LaserScan` display by topic and visualize `/laser_front/scan` in the 3D view port.

# Summary

Now you have an initial bring-up for **SICK S300 Safety Laser Scanner**.
You may need to tweak other parameters to reflect the settings of your laser scanner.
