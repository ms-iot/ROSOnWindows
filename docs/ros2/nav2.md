# ROS2 Navigation 2 with Windows
[Nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/) is the next generation ROS Navigation stack for ROS 2.
This short guide shows you how to quickly get started with **Navigation 2** on Windows.

## Objectives

  * Exercise the ROS 2 on Windows installation.
  * Bootstrap an environment running **Navigation 2** with Turtlebot.

## Prerequisites
This walkthrough depends on having [ROS 2 Foxy on Windows](../GettingStarted/SetupRos2.md) installed.


## Create a Navigation 2 Workspace

Create a empty workspace to contain the [Robotis Turtlebot3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/) Navigation2 sources. 
This is a quick walkthrough, a complete set of tutorials is available on the Robotis website. 

```bat
:: create a empty workspace
mkdir c:\nav2_ws\src
pushd c:\nav2_ws

curl -o nav2.repos https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-iot/ROSOnWindows/master/docs/ros2/navigation2_foxy.repos
vcs import src < nav2.repos
```

## Build and Activate the Navigation 2 Workspace

Build the workspace by `colcon` build tool.

```bat
:: change to the root of workspace
pushd c:\nav2_ws

:: build the workspace
colcon build
```

Activate the workspace which was built.

```bat
:: activate the workspace so that ROS can find your freshly built binaries.
install\setup.bat
```

## One Time Setup
In order to "seed" your environment, you'll either need to create a navigation map, or use the following commands to download a pregenerated one:
```cmd
curl -o c:\nav2_ws\map.pgm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/master/turtlebot3_navigation/maps/map.pgm
curl -o c:\nav2_ws\map.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/master/turtlebot3_navigation/maps/map.yaml
```


## Verify your environment with Gazebo and TurtleBot3

To run this walkthrough you will need two terminal windows with the ROS2 environment loaded. 

In the both terminal windows, perform the following actions:

```bat
cd c:\nav2_ws
set GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=C:\nav2_ws\install\turtlebot3_gazebo\share\turtlebot3_gazebo\models;%GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH%
set TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
```

Now in terminal window one, launch the simulation environment:

```cmd
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```
The Gazebo Simulation environment will take several minutes to load the first time, as it is attempting to download assets from the network.

In terminal window two, launch the navigation stack.
```cmd
ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py map:=c:\nav2_ws\map.yaml
```

After a few moments, you should see `TurtleBot3` in a simulation world and the respective map shows in `RViz`. You may notice many warnings in the terminal window, this is normal. 

Before navigating the robot, you must set the initial pose of the robot:

1. Select `2D pose estimate` button in the toolbar of `RViz`.
1. Align the cursor to where the Turtlebot appears in the map.
1. Press the left mouse button without releasing, then drag in the direction the turtlebot is facing, then release the mouse button. 
1. You should now see the costmap displayed.
1. You can now use the `Navigation2 goal` button to set a goal. 
1. Similar to setting the initial position, press the left button where you would like the robot to move to, then drag in the direction you'd like it to face when it completes. 
1. When you release the mouse button, the robot will navigate around obsticals. 

> Note: To shutdown Gazebo, please close the Window, otherwise the UI can hang requiring termination through the Windows task manager.

## Explore Navigation 2 Samples

There are many **Navigation 2** resources online.
Here we share some good starting points:
