# Why we marry Vcpkg with Rosdep

Today, many ROS packages consume OSS libraries which are much beyond [ROS on Windows Chocolatey server](https://roswin.azurewebsites.net/) for `Open Robotics` core packages. To enable developers lighting up more ROS packages on Windows, we leverage the [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) community (which has 1000+ OSS libraries ports), and extend `rosdep` to manage Vcpkg packages which are known to work with `ROS on Windows` installation. It means ROS developer can either consume the OOS libraries right away if they are in Vcpkg ports, or they can contribute Vcpkg ports back which benefit ROS community.

# Example Workflow

Let's take [koboki](http://wiki.ros.org/kobuki) as an example. After checking out the source code and running `rosdep check`, two missing requirements are reported from here: `libusb-dev` and `libftdi-dev`. They are the rosdep keys, so you will need another look up to see what's the actual package names for platforms. By checking [`index.ros.org`](https://index.ros.org), they are found as `libusb-dev` and `libftdi-dev` respectively on Ubuntu. By a further check, they are registered as [`libftdi-dev (0.20-4build3)`](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libftdi-dev) and [`libusb-dev (2:0.1.12-31)`](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libusb-dev) on [`packages.ubuntu.com`](https://packages.ubuntu.com), which gives us an idea what version to use.

Back to Vcpkg, `libusb-dev` can be found as `libusb-win32`. You can do `vcpkg install libusb-win32:x64-windows` from the ROS command prompt. Since Vcpkg is integrated with your ROS installation already, developers can do `catkin_make` to iterate on Windows port work. And in this example, `libftdi-dev` is not found in Vcpkg. It is because the library is not ported yet in Vcpkg. You can make a Vcpkg port for it, and contributethe Vcpkg recipe back to [Microsoft\Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

> As of today, a port for  `libftdi-dev` is contributed back to [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/6843).

After a Windows port finished, developers can send pull request to register Vcpkg port to Rosdep keys (https://github.com/ms-iot/rosdistro-db/blob/init_windows/rosdep/vcpkg.yaml). So the next time for who wants to build koboki, installing the system dependencies can be simplified to by running `rosdep install`.


# How do I try it out

This new integration is avaiable in the build of `20190617.1.0-pre` and above. To try it out, run Chocolatey upgrade to use the prerelease builds:

`choco upgrade ros-melodic-desktop_full -y --pre`


# Feedback

For any feedback, please open an issue on [ms-iot\ROSOnWindows](https://github.com/ms-iot/rosonWindows/issues). We will help you there.
