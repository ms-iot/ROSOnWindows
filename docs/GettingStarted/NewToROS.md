# New ROS Users
The Robot Operating System is a powerful tool for creating Robots with advanced behaviors. Using ROS is a skill by itself, and like all skills takes time and energy to become proficient and eventually master.

To support the new ROS user, the ROS community create a set of tutortials which walk through the basics through advanced usage of ROS. Visit the [Tutorial Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) &nearr;. 

These tutorials were written for ROS on Linux. While running through the tutorials, please refer to [Using ROS for Windows](UsingROSonWindows.md).
