After comparison, we see most of packages to exist on Vcpkg. Only few don't exist and need some more investigations: * libompl * log4cxx * libgraphviz * pkg-config Also, some projects are Python modules mixing C/C++ sources (e.g., pyside2), and Vcpkg currently doesn't manage this type of projects.

Configure Chocolatey sources choco source add -n=ros-win -s=\"https://roswin.azurewebsites.net/api/v2\" --priority=1 choco source disable -n=chocolatey This will add roswin Chocolatey server as a source to discover libraries and tools. Also disable the default one to avoid any potential package naming conflicts. Installation Start by building the core ROS packages. Create a catkin Workspace In order to build the core packages, you will need a catkin workspace. Create one now: mkdir c:\\ros_catkin_ws cd c:\\ros_catkin_ws Next we will want to fetch the core packages so we can build them. We will use wstool for this. Select the wstool command for the particular variant you want to install: Desktop Install (recommended): ROS, rqt, rviz, and robot-generic libraries set ROSDISTRO_INDEX_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-iot/rosdistro-db/init_windows/index.yaml rosinstall_generator desktop --rosdistro melodic --deps --upstream-development > melodic-desktop.rosinstall wstool init src melodic-desktop.rosinstall ROS-Comm: (Bare Bones) ROS package, build, and communication libraries. No GUI tools. set ROSDISTRO_INDEX_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ms-iot/rosdistro-db/init_windows/index.yaml rosinstall_generator ros_comm --rosdistro melodic --deps --upstream-development > melodic-ros_comm.rosinstall wstool init src melodic-ros_comm.rosinstall This will add all of the catkin packages in the given variant and then fetch the sources into the ~/ros_catkin_ws/src directory. The command will take a few minutes to download all of the core ROS packages into the src folder. Resolving Dependencies Before you can build your catkin workspace you need to make sure that you have all the required dependencies. We use the rosdep tool for this: rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro melodic -r -y This will look at all of the packages in the src directory and find all of the dependencies they have. Then it will recursively install the dependencies. The --from-paths option indicates we want to install the dependencies for an entire directory of packages, in this case src. The --ignore-src option indicates to rosdep that it shouldn't try to install any ROS packages in the src folder from the package manager, we don't need it to since we are building them ourselves. The --rosdistro option is required because we don't have a ROS environment setup yet, so we have to indicate to rosdep what version of ROS we are building for. Finally, the -y option indicates to rosdep that we don't want to be bothered by too many prompts from the package manager. After a while (and maybe some prompts for your password) rosdep will finish installing system dependencies and you can continue. Building the catkin Workspace Once it has completed downloading the packages and resolving the dependencies you are ready to build the catkin packages. We will use the catkin_make_isolated command because there are both catkin and plain cmake packages in the base install, when developing on your catkin only workspaces you may choose to use catkin/commands/catkin_make which only works with catkin packages. Invoke catkin_make_isolated: set PATH=c:\\opt\\rosdeps\\x64\\bin;%PATH% copy \".\\src\\catkin\\bin\\catkin_make_isolated\" \".\\src\\catkin\\bin\\catkin_make_isolated.py\" python .\\src\\catkin\\bin\\catkin_make_isolated.py --use-nmake --install ^ --install-space c:/opt/ros/melodic/x64 ^ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^ -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=c:/opt/ros/melodic/x64;c:/opt/rosdeps/x64 The rosdep BIN path needs to be added to PATH so catkin can find the build tools (e.g. CMake). Now the packages should have been installed to c:/opt/ros/melodic/x64 or to wherever you specified with the --install-space argument.

In this example, it defines a Github repository reference to ms-iot\\rosonwindows_ci and use an endpoint to access it. Replace endpoint to your Github account (or your GitHub service connection name). jobs\\template defines what template to be included. In this example, include build.yml@templates , which means to refer to the build.yml under ms-iot\\rosonwindows_ci GitHub repository. Under template , there are some parameters to customize your CI build: * ros_metapackage : It is the basic image to check out for CI build. In this example, it will install ros-melodic-desktop before the CI build. * custom_test_target : For projects which do not have run_tests as default test target, it can be set to a customized test target.

To enable developers lighting up more ROS packages on Windows, we leverage the Vcpkg community (which has 1000+ OSS libraries ports), and extend rosdep to manage Vcpkg packages which are known to work with ROS on Windows installation. It means ROS developer can either consume the OOS libraries right away if they are in Vcpkg ports, or they can contribute Vcpkg ports back which benefit ROS community. Example Workflow Let's take koboki as an example. After checking out the source code and running rosdep check , two missing requirements are reported from here: libusb-dev and libftdi-dev . They are the rosdep keys, so you will need another look up to see what's the actual package names for platforms. By checking index.ros.org , they are found as libusb-dev and libftdi-dev respectively on Ubuntu. By a further check, they are registered as libftdi-dev (0.20-4build3) and libusb-dev (2:0.1.12-31) on packages.ubuntu.com , which gives us an idea what version to use. Back to Vcpkg, libusb-dev can be found as libusb-win32 . You can do vcpkg install libusb-win32:x64-windows from the ROS command prompt. Since Vcpkg is integrated with your ROS installation already, developers can do catkin_make to iterate on Windows port work. And in this example, libftdi-dev is not found in Vcpkg. It is because the library is not ported yet in Vcpkg. You can make a Vcpkg port for it, and contributethe Vcpkg recipe back to Microsoft\\Vcpkg . As of today, a port for libftdi-dev is contributed back to Vcpkg . After a Windows port finished, developers can send pull request to register Vcpkg port to Rosdep keys (https://github.com/ms-iot/rosdistro-db/blob/init_windows/rosdep/vcpkg.yaml). So the next time for who wants to build koboki, installing the system dependencies can be simplified to by running rosdep install .

Definitions related to this analysis in the Bond class include: the Bond class defines timers for different purposes. The timer related to this issue is the connect_timer_ variable the Bond class initializes all timers with default timeout values. The default timeout value for connect_timer_ is bond::Constants::DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT , which is 10.0 seconds by default the Bond class defines both ros::Subscriber sub_ and ros::Publisher pub_ , which are initialized upon Bond::start() When a nodelet requests the manager to load code, a bond (if requested) will also be attempted to be formed. During this process, the nodelet manager and the child talk in the following steps: child sends /load_nodelet service request to manager manager receives /load_nodelet service request and loads nodelet code manager process creates bond by calling bond->start() , and starts sending out heartbeat periodically child receives (success) response from /load_nodelet service request child process creates bond by calling bond->start() , and starts sending out heartbeat periodically the bond class recognizes a connection between 2 process when its subscriber receives the first heartbeat signal from the other process. when the heartbeat signal takes too long to be received, it will mark the connection as timed out. the following is a typical network log when the bond between a nodelet manager process and the nodelet process after removing the timeout. as we can see, the connection ultimately gets established after more than 10 seconds [ INFO] [1562890405.970666100]: creating bond [ed2a422e-61dc-4904-88df-2f37e511b35d] in manager process [ INFO] [1562890405.994268400]: starting bond [0609a515-48ac-4e2e-8a2c-6fd36ef697ff] in nodelet process [ INFO] [1562890406.975367400]: ed2a422e-61dc-4904-88df-2f37e511b35d: heartbeat -

The log indicates: both bonds have been properly initialized publishers and subscribers of both bonds have also been properly initialized b1-sub is not getting signal from b2-pub b2-sub is getting signal from b1-pub as expected Noticing that b1 with its publisher and subscriber are created earlier than b2 and its publisher and subscriber, we can conclude that b1-pub is created earlier than b2-sub (this is because publisher and subscriber creation code is blocking). Meantime, however, b2-pub is created later than b1-sub . Would this be the reason for the behavior above? Searching online would lead us to this question that has been discussed on answers.ros. The root cause for this is that when a publisher is created later than a subscriber, the subscriber takes a long time to establish a connection with the newly emerged publisher. As explained in the \"Node Environment Variables\" section of this ROS documentation , when a machine has more than one network name this problem starts to emerge. To work around it, use the ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME environment variable to specify a designated connection. The network log proves that it works: [ INFO] [1562890762.216079700]: creating bond [469d6a4a-6f6c-40e9-a35a-05526812d10e] in manager process [ INFO] [1562890763.272645100]: starting bond [260dff49-6afa-47a3-b288-fb560cd53edc] in nodelet process [ INFO] [1562890763.220602400]: 469d6a4a-6f6c-40e9-a35a-05526812d10e: heartbeat -

Definitions related to this analysis in the Bond class include: the Bond class defines timers for different purposes. The timer related to this issue is the connect_timer_ variable the Bond class initializes all timers with default timeout values. The default timeout value for connect_timer_ is bond::Constants::DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT , which is 10.0 seconds by default the Bond class defines both ros::Subscriber sub_ and ros::Publisher pub_ , which are initialized upon Bond::start() When a nodelet requests the manager to load code, a bond (if requested) will also be attempted to be formed. During this process, the nodelet manager and the child talk in the following steps: child sends /load_nodelet service request to manager manager receives /load_nodelet service request and loads nodelet code manager process creates bond by calling bond->start() , and starts sending out heartbeat periodically child receives (success) response from /load_nodelet service request child process creates bond by calling bond->start() , and starts sending out heartbeat periodically the bond class recognizes a connection between 2 process when its subscriber receives the first heartbeat signal from the other process. when the heartbeat signal takes too long to be received, it will mark the connection as timed out. the following is a typical network log when the bond between a nodelet manager process and the nodelet process after removing the timeout. as we can see, the connection ultimately gets established after more than 10 seconds [ INFO] [1562890405.970666100]: creating bond [ed2a422e-61dc-4904-88df-2f37e511b35d] in manager process [ INFO] [1562890405.994268400]: starting bond [0609a515-48ac-4e2e-8a2c-6fd36ef697ff] in nodelet process [ INFO] [1562890406.975367400]: ed2a422e-61dc-4904-88df-2f37e511b35d: heartbeat -

The log indicates: both bonds have been properly initialized publishers and subscribers of both bonds have also been properly initialized b1-sub is not getting signal from b2-pub b2-sub is getting signal from b1-pub as expected Noticing that b1 with its publisher and subscriber are created earlier than b2 and its publisher and subscriber, we can conclude that b1-pub is created earlier than b2-sub (this is because publisher and subscriber creation code is blocking). Meantime, however, b2-pub is created later than b1-sub . Would this be the reason for the behavior above? Searching online would lead us to this question that has been discussed on answers.ros. The root cause for this is that when a publisher is created later than a subscriber, the subscriber takes a long time to establish a connection with the newly emerged publisher. As explained in the \"Node Environment Variables\" section of this ROS documentation , when a machine has more than one network name this problem starts to emerge. To work around it, use the ROS_IP or ROS_HOSTNAME environment variable to specify a designated connection. The network log proves that it works: [ INFO] [1562890762.216079700]: creating bond [469d6a4a-6f6c-40e9-a35a-05526812d10e] in manager process [ INFO] [1562890763.272645100]: starting bond [260dff49-6afa-47a3-b288-fb560cd53edc] in nodelet process [ INFO] [1562890763.220602400]: 469d6a4a-6f6c-40e9-a35a-05526812d10e: heartbeat -

This cookbook is intended to collect common issues and recommended solutions. Windows and Linux Differences C++ 17 In your CMakeLists.txt add the compile option: add_compile_options(/std:c++latest) Directory Separators Windows uses backslash \\ whereas Linux uses forward slash / . As we encounter path processing, we've been replacing them with the Python or Boost equivelents. User directory Linux has a neat shortcut for refering to the users' home directory ~ . Windows uses the environment variable %USERPROFILE% - use this whenever you see ~ in ROS documentation. Quote handling in command window Cmd.exe is the command processor of command window. Single quotes are not used at all by the cmd.exe except in batch file to enclose the command to run within a FOR /F statement. Cmd.exe handles quoting with double quotes. This is different from Linux that uses single quote as quote character. As encounter quoting on Windows, please use double quote. The following example shows using double quotes around the message contents: rostopic pub -1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- \"[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]\" \"[0.0, 0.0, 1.8]\" Paths and ROS commands Many ROS Commands are sensitive to the drive letter they are executed from. This manifests in problems such as rosdeps not resolving correctly. To address this either: * Put all of your ROS workspaces on the C:\\ drive * Link folders from your C:\\ drive to your workspaces. To link a folder on Windows, use the mklink to create a filesystem link from one drive to another.: mkdir d:\\workspaces mklink c:\\workspaces d:\\workspaces Symbol Visibility Windows and Linux handle symbol visibility differently. You may encounter a build error of the form: error C2448: '__attribute__': function-style initializer appears to be a function definition 'visibility': identifier not found The GCC visibility documentation \u2197 has a good article on handling the compiler differences. This includes adding a header file which uses a compiler switch to select the correct visibility macro handler. Symbol Visibility also impacts binary loading. If you are finding a Nodelet that does not run or a Qt Visualizer isn't working, it may be that the hosting process can not find an expected binary export. To diagnose this on Windows, the Windows developer tools includes a program called Gflags to enable various options. One of those options is called Loader Snaps which enables you to detect load failures while debugging. Please visit the Microsoft Documentation for more information on Gflags and Loaders snaps . install Library TARGETS given no DESTINATION! Windows will generate separate archives and librarys. To handle this, add an ARCHIVE destination: install( TARGETS ${PROJECT_NAME} ARCHIVE DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION} LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_LIB_DESTINATION}) All Warnings Warnings are good. The options for selecting warning level are different. If you add specific compiler options for warnings, please add an MSVC selection. For the Visual Studio compiler, you'll use /W3 for warning level 3 (or /W4 which offers more warning options). If you would like to treat warnings as errors pass /WX . However, these warnings would need to be corrected before the compile will succeed. if(MSVC) add_compile_options(/W3 /WX) else() add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra) endif() You can disable specific warnings using #pragma : #ifdef _MSC_VER #pragma warning(disable: 4244) #pragma warning(disable: 4661) #endif Security Warnings Windows deprecates certain C APIs because they are inherently insecure. You will receive a message of the form: warning C4996: 'xxx': This function or variable may be unsafe. Consider using xxx_s instead. To disable deprecation, use _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS. See online help for details. Consider using modern equivelents. If you cannot use a modern equivelent, you can add the following to your cmake files: add_definitions(\"/D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS\") add_definitions(\"/D_SILENCE_ALL_CXX17_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS\") C++ versioning Use CMake to set the C++ version: if(NOT CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD) set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11) endif() _attribute _ _attribute _ is not suppported on MSVC. You can use a macro replacement or use a cross platform convention. Unresolved External Linux automatically exports symbols. Windows, symbols are private by default. CMake provides a facility for this . In your cmake: set(CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS ON) However, you may encounter a problem with static class members, i.e. global data symbols, as discussed in https://blog.kitware.com/create-dlls-on-windows-without-declspec-using-new-cmake-export-all-feature/. In this case you need to manually handle visibility of the static class members, using the GenerateExportHeader CMake module. In particular, if your static class members are contained in a library called mylibrary , you need to add the following lines in your CMake after the call to add_library(mylibrary ...) : include(GenerateExportHeader) generate_export_header(mylibrary) target_include_directories(mylibrary PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}) The generate_export_header(mylibrary) call creates a file called mylibrary_export.h , contained in the ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} build directory. This file contains the definition of the mylibrary_EXPORT macro, that you can use to modify your code as in the following: #include \"mylibrary_export.h\" class myclass { static mylibrary_EXPORT int GlobalCounter; \u2026 If this class definition is contained in a public header, you need to make sure to install the generated mylibrary_export.h together with the rest of the headers, i.e. : install(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/mylibrary_export.h DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_INCLUDE_DESTINATION}) Beware of aggressive optimization The Microsoft compiler will optimize agressively. This can manifest in strange ways. One instance was in turtlebot3 fake code, is a ROS_ASSERT with a function that only returns true. Nothing else executed. Case sensitivity Linux is case sensitive, whereas Windows is not. We are trying to locate case sensitive areas and isolate them. This manifests in odd errors like this: RLException: multiple files named [turtlebot3_robot.launch] in package [turtlebot3_bringup]: - C:\\ws\\turtlebot_ws\\install\\share\\turtlebot3_bringup\\launch\\turtlebot3_robot.launch - c:\\ws\\turtlebot_ws\\install\\share\\turtlebot3_bringup\\launch\\turtlebot3_robot.launch In this case, the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH has a lower case drive letter. Python Shebang Windows does not support Shebang character sequence for automatically launching an interpreter. To support Python nodes on Windows, a few changes need to be made. Shebang in ROS nodes If a ROS node uses Python, please rename the file with the .py extension. Shebang in command line commands If you are producing a command line application which will be installed with Pip, please add a windows wrapper.

It is a widely used protocol for industrial applications. In this tutorial, I will show you how to install and consume an open source EtherCAT master implementation, SOEM (Simple Open EtherCAT Master), and discover devices on a EtherCAT network in a ROS workspace. For more information, visit https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM . Prerequisite You have a machine with Windows 10 installed. You have ROS Melodic Desktop Full installed. You have a EtherCAT slave controller commissioned to work. You have a EtherCAT network topology configured physically. You have basic knowledge to EtherCAT technology. Step 1: Add SOEM Library to your Workspace Firstly, you will need a catkin workspace to begin with. Let's assume you are working on an empty workspace under c:\\ethercat_ws . You can install SOEM from vcpkg : :: install vcpkg SOEM port c:\\ethercat_ws> vcpkg install SOEM:x64-windows Step 2: Create your own Package Now you have the required libraries. Let's begin with a new package and build with SOEM . :: change the directory to the source subfolder. c:\\ethercat_ws> cd src :: create your owned package c:\\ethercat_ws\\src> catkin_create_pkg my_pkg Step 3: Add SOEM Application Code Copy slaveinfo.c into the new package as the SOEM application code to run. :: make the directory to store the source. c:\\ethercat_ws> mkdir src\\my_pkg\\src :: download the source of `slaveinfo.c` c:\\ethercat_ws> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM/master/test/linux/slaveinfo/slaveinfo.c -o src\\my_pkg\\src\\slaveinfo.c Step 4: Edit CMakeLists.txt You will also needs to edit the src\\my_pkg\\CMakeLists.txt to author the new executable and to be explicit on SOEM as dependency. Here is the CMake recipe to add to look for SOEM : find_path(winpcap_INCLUDE_DIRS NAMES pcap.h) find_library(winpcap_LIBRARY NAMES wpcap) find_library(packet_LIBRARY NAMES packet) find_path(soem_INCLUDE_DIRS NAMES ethercat.h PATH_SUFFIXES soem) find_library(soem_LIBRARY NAMES soem) Here is the recipe to author the slaveinfo.c as an excutable: include_directories( ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${soem_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${winpcap_INCLUDE_DIRS} ) add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}_node src/slaveinfo.c) set_target_properties(${PROJECT_NAME}_node PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME slaveinfo PREFIX \"\") add_dependencies(${PROJECT_NAME}_node ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXPORTED_TARGETS} ${catkin_EXPORTED_TARGETS}) target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}_node ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${soem_LIBRARY} ${winpcap_LIBRARY} ${packet_LIBRARY} Ws2_32.lib Winmm.lib ) Step 5: Build the Workspace Let's build the workspace to produce the executables and binaries. And remember to run setup.bat to add the development space into the current environment. :: Build the workspace c:\\ethercat_ws> catkin_make :: Add the development space into the current environment. c:\\ethercat_ws> devel\\setup.bat Step 6: Check EtherCAT Network Let's check the EtherCAT network to make sure the SOEM and the EtherCAT network is working.

In this tutorial, I will be using cob_sick_s300 , a community ROS package, to drive SICK S300 to get the laser scan messages into ROS topics. For more information, see http://wiki.ros.org/cob_sick_s300 . Prerequisite You have a machine with Windows 10 installed. You have ROS Melodic Desktop Full installed. You have a SICK S300 Safety Laser Scanner commissioned to operate and connected to your host machine over a serial port. This tutorial applies to: S300 Standard S300 Advanced S300 Professional S300 Expert Step 1: Clone the Driver Package Firstly, you will need a catkin workspace to contain the driver package.
